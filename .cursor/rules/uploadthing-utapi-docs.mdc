# UTApi - UploadThing Docs

The UploadThing API Helper, for use ON YOUR SERVER. It's basically just a REST API but better.

Please note that external API calls will almost always be slower than querying your own database. We recommend storing the file data you need in your own database, either in [`.onUploadComplete()`](/file-routes#on-upload-complete) or after uploading files using [`uploadFiles()`](/api-reference/ut-api#upload-files), instead of relying on the API for your application's core data flow.

Since 5.7

Prior to `v5.7`, the `UTApi` was exported as an object called `utapi` without any custom intialization support.

To get started, initialize an instance of `UTApi`.

### [Options](#options)

You can configure the SDK either by passing them as options to the constructor, or by setting them as environment variables. Environment variables follow the naming convention of `UPLOADTHING_<NAME>` ,where `<NAME>` is the name of the config option in constant case, e.g. `UPLOADTHING_LOG_LEVEL`. If both are set, the config object takes precedence.

methodSince 5.3

Upload files directly from your server **without** using the file router. Useful for server-side file processing, uploading from a server action, and much more.

When uploading files using `uploadFiles`, the files must be present on your server. Then presigned URLs are generated on our servers before the files can be uploaded to the storage provider.

### [Returns](#returns-3)

`object`

methodSince 4.0DEPRECATED

`getFileUrls` takes in a fileKey or an array of fileKeys and returns the URLs to access them.

This method is deprecated and will be removed in a future version. Please refer to [Accessing Files](/working-with-files#accessing-files) to learn how to access your files without extra roundtrips for API calls.

### [Parameters](#parameters-4)

Pass in the key(s) you want to get the URLs for as the first argument. Additionally, you may pass some options as a second argument:

-   Name
    
    **keys**
    
    Type

    Description

### [Returns](#returns-4)

`object`

methodSince 5.3

`listFiles` returns a paginated list of objects containing file ids and keys for all files that have been uploaded to the application your API key corresponds to.

We do not recommend using this as your primary data source. Instead, we recommend storing the file metadata (key, url, etc) in your database. This will reduce latency as well as support any query your application might need. The `listFiles` method is best suited for administrative tasks, one-time data synchronization, or debugging purposes.

### [Parameters](#parameters-5)

    **opts.limit**
    
    Type
    
    `number`

### [Returns](#returns-6)

`object`

methodSince 7.5

Generate a presigned URL for a private file.

Unlike [`getSignedURL`](#get-signed-url), this method does not make a fetch request to the UploadThing API and is the recommended way to generate a presigned URL for a private file.

### [Parameters](#parameters-6)

-   Name
    
    **key**
    
    Type

    Since 7.5
    
    Description
    
    Options for the signed URL. The parsed duration cannot exceed 7 days (604 800).
    
    `TimeString` refers to a human-readable string that can be parsed as a number, followed by a unit of time. For example, `1s`, `1 second`, `2m`, `2 minutes`, `7 days` etc. If no unit is specified, seconds are assumed.
    

### [Returns](#returns-7)

`{ ufsUrl: string }`

methodSince 6.2

Retrieve a [signed URL](/concepts/regions-acl#access-controls) for a private file. This method is no longer recommended as it makes a fetch request to the UploadThing API which incurs additional, unnecessary latency. Use [`generateSignedURL`](#generate-signed-url) instead.

The `expiresIn` option can only be used if you allow overrides in your app settings on the UploadThing dashboard.
