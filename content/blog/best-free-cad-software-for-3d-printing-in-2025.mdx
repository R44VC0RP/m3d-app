You've got a great idea for a 3D print. Maybe it's a custom bracket for your shelf, a replacement part for an appliance, or a gift you can't find anywhere else. Now you just need to design it—but CAD software can cost hundreds of dollars.

Good news: you don't need to spend a dime. There's excellent free software available at every skill level, from absolute beginners to experienced designers. Here's my honest take on the best options in 2025.

## For Absolute Beginners: TinkerCAD

If you've never designed anything in 3D before, start here. TinkerCAD is browser-based, free, and built specifically for beginners. You drag and drop shapes, combine them, subtract them, and export to STL. That's it.

**What makes it great:**
- Zero installation—runs in your browser
- Intuitive drag-and-drop interface
- Built-in tutorials that actually teach you something
- Direct STL export for 3D printing
- Cloud saves mean you can work from any computer

**Where it falls short:**
- Limited to basic shapes and operations
- No parametric design (more on that later)
- You'll outgrow it if you get serious about design

TinkerCAD is perfect for simple projects: custom nameplates, basic phone stands, simple organizers. If your design is mostly boxes, cylinders, and combinations of basic shapes, TinkerCAD handles it beautifully.

**Who should use it:** Complete beginners, kids, educators, and anyone who just needs something simple without a learning curve.

## For Serious Hobbyists: Fusion 360 Personal Use

Autodesk's Fusion 360 is professional-grade software with a genuinely free tier for hobbyists. The personal use license lets you access most features—including everything you need for 3D printing—as long as you're not making more than $1,000 per year from your designs.

**What makes it great:**
- Professional parametric modeling tools
- Built-in simulation and analysis
- Excellent tutorial ecosystem
- Direct STL and 3MF export
- 3-year license term (recently extended)
- Works on Windows and Mac

**What you get for free:**
- Standard design and 3D modeling tools
- 2.5-axis and 3-axis milling for CNC
- FFF additive manufacturing features
- Export to STEP, STL, OBJ, and more

**The limitations:**
- Maximum 10 active (editable) documents at once
- Cloud-based, so you need internet to work
- Some advanced features are locked
- Requires Autodesk account and verification

Fusion 360's parametric design capability is the real selling point. Unlike TinkerCAD where moving one part of your design can break everything else, Fusion 360 lets you define relationships between features. Change one dimension and related features update automatically. This is invaluable when you're iterating on a design or need to make size adjustments later.

**Who should use it:** Hobbyists who want professional tools, makers designing functional parts, anyone who needs parametric design without paying for it.

## For Open Source Advocates: FreeCAD

FreeCAD is completely free, open source, and runs on Windows, Mac, and Linux. Version 1.0 (released in late 2024) was a major milestone that addressed many long-standing usability issues.

**What makes it great:**
- Truly free with no restrictions
- Powerful parametric modeling
- Works offline—your files stay on your computer
- Active community and plugin ecosystem
- New built-in assembly workbench in version 1.0
- Exports to every format you'll need

**The honest downsides:**
- Steeper learning curve than commercial alternatives
- Interface can feel dated
- Occasional quirks that require workarounds
- Documentation varies in quality

FreeCAD is organized into "workbenches"—specialized toolsets for different tasks. The Part Design Workbench handles most 3D printing design needs, while the Mesh Workbench helps repair and modify STL files.

The parametric approach means every dimension you set is a parameter you can change later. Designing a bracket and realized it needs to be 5mm longer? Change one number and the entire model updates. This is how professional engineers work, and FreeCAD gives you that capability for free.

**Who should use it:** Linux users, privacy-conscious designers, people who want full control over their software, anyone opposed to subscription software on principle.

## For Artists and Organic Shapes: Blender

Blender isn't CAD software—it's a 3D graphics suite used for animation, visual effects, and digital art. But it's also surprisingly capable for 3D printing, especially for organic shapes and artistic designs.

**What makes it great:**
- Completely free and open source
- Unmatched for sculpting organic forms
- Built-in 3D Print Toolbox addon
- Massive community and tutorial library
- Handles complex meshes that would choke other software

**The 3D printing workflow:**
- Enable the 3D Print Toolbox addon (it ships with Blender)
- Use the analysis tools to check for non-manifold geometry
- Fix common issues like holes and inverted normals
- Export directly to STL with unit settings

**Where it struggles:**
- Not designed for precise dimensional work
- Learning curve is notoriously steep
- Overkill if you just need simple geometric parts
- Default units can cause confusion (Blender uses meters)

Blender shines when you're creating figurines, sculptures, terrain, or anything organic. If you're designing a character for printing or a decorative piece with flowing curves, Blender's sculpting tools are unmatched. For a simple bracket or box? Use something else.

**Who should use it:** Artists, sculptors, miniature designers, anyone creating organic shapes, people who already know Blender from other work.

## For Programmers and Engineers: OpenSCAD

OpenSCAD takes a completely different approach: you write code that describes your model. No clicking, no dragging—just text that compiles into geometry.

For example, a parametric box is defined by setting variables for width, height, depth, and wall thickness, then using CSG operations like `difference()` and `cube()` to create the shape. Change one variable and the entire model updates—that's the power of code-based design.

**What makes it great:**
- Parametric by default—every dimension is a variable
- Version control friendly (it's just text files)
- Reproducible results every time
- Perfect for patterns and mathematical shapes
- Models are guaranteed manifold and printable

**The trade-offs:**
- Requires programming mindset
- No visual manipulation of models
- Slower iteration than graphical tools
- Limited to constructive solid geometry

OpenSCAD is perfect when you need to generate many variations of a design or when precision matters more than visual feedback. If you want to create a custom case that fits exactly around your electronics, defining every dimension as a variable makes future adjustments trivial.

**Who should use it:** Programmers, engineers, mathematically-inclined designers, anyone who thinks in code, people creating parametric models for sharing.

## For Cloud Collaboration: Onshape

Onshape is fully browser-based professional CAD—no downloads, no installations, works on any computer with a modern browser.

**What makes it great:**
- True professional-grade parametric CAD
- Real-time collaboration (like Google Docs for CAD)
- Works on any platform including Chromebooks
- Excellent feature set even on free tier
- Version control built in

**The catch:**
- Free tier makes all your designs public
- Need phone number to sign up
- Not for commercial use on free tier
- Requires constant internet connection

If you're okay with your designs being public, Onshape's free tier is remarkably capable. The collaboration features are genuine—multiple people can work on the same model simultaneously, which is rare in CAD software.

**Who should use it:** Students, educators, collaborative teams, anyone on a Chromebook, people who don't mind public designs.

## My Recommendations by Use Case

**"I just want to make something simple"**
Start with TinkerCAD. You'll be exporting an STL in 20 minutes.

**"I want to learn proper CAD skills"**
Go with Fusion 360 Personal Use. The skills transfer to paid software if you ever go professional.

**"I need precise mechanical parts"**
FreeCAD or Fusion 360. Both offer proper parametric design.

**"I'm making artistic/organic models"**
Blender is your tool. Nothing else comes close for sculpting.

**"I want everything defined in code"**
OpenSCAD. Once you learn it, you'll never look back for certain types of projects.

**"I want maximum flexibility with no cost ever"**
FreeCAD. Open source, no accounts, no restrictions.

## Getting Your Designs Printed

Once you've designed your model, you'll need it printed. All of these programs export to STL, the standard format for 3D printing.

At Mandarin3D, we print from STL, OBJ, and 3MF files using our BambuLab printers. Our 250mm³ build volume handles most hobby projects comfortably, and we print in both PLA and PETG depending on your needs.

If you've designed something but aren't sure if it's printable—wall thickness, overhangs, that sort of thing—[upload your file](/upload) and I'll take a look. Design feedback is part of what makes working with a local print service better than uploading to an anonymous online queue.

Already have a design ready? Send it over. Got questions about which software to learn? Drop me a line. The best software is the one you'll actually use, and I'm happy to help you figure out which that is.
