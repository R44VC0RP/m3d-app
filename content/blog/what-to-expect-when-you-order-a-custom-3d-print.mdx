Ordering a custom 3D print for the first time can feel like a leap of faith. You upload a file, pick some options, and then... what? Understanding what happens behind the scenes helps you set realistic expectations and get better results. Here's the complete journey your order takes from upload to delivery.

## The Upload and Quote Phase

Every order starts with a file. You'll upload your 3D model—typically in STL, OBJ, or 3MF format—and the system analyzes it instantly. Within seconds, you'll see:

- **Physical dimensions** of your part
- **Estimated print time** based on size and complexity
- **Material options** available for your design
- **Price** based on all of the above

This instant feedback is your first checkpoint. If the dimensions look wrong (a common issue when files are designed in inches but interpreted as millimeters), you'll catch it here before anything gets printed.

### What Affects the Price?

Three main factors determine cost:

**Size matters most.** A larger part uses more material and takes more print time. Doubling the dimensions doesn't double the cost—it roughly octuples it, because volume increases in three dimensions.

**Material choice.** PLA is the most affordable option. PETG costs slightly more due to its enhanced durability and heat resistance. Specialty materials like TPU (flexible) or high-temperature filaments carry higher price tags.

**Complexity and print time.** Intricate details, lots of overhangs requiring supports, and certain geometries extend print time. More time on the printer means higher cost.

## The Review Process

Here's where working with a real print service differs from fully automated platforms. After you place your order, we actually look at your file.

### What We Check

**Printability.** Is this design physically possible to print? Some geometries that look fine on screen won't work in the real world. Floating parts, impossible overhangs, and features smaller than the printer can resolve all get flagged.

**Wall thickness.** This is the number one cause of failed prints. Walls under 1.2mm are risky; we'll let you know if we spot thin sections that might not print reliably.

**Orientation optimization.** How a part sits on the print bed affects strength, surface quality, and print time. Sometimes rotating a model 90 degrees cuts print time in half while improving quality.

**Support requirements.** We determine where support structures are needed and plan their placement to minimize surface marks on visible faces.

### Communication Before Printing

If we spot issues, you'll hear from us before we start printing. This might be a quick email saying "heads up, these thin walls might be fragile" or a more detailed message explaining why a design needs modifications.

This review step catches problems that would otherwise waste your time and money. It's the advantage of working with humans who actually understand 3D printing, not just automated systems that blindly process whatever you upload.

## The Printing Phase

Once your design clears review, it enters the print queue. Here's what happens during actual production.

### Print Preparation (Slicing)

Your 3D model gets converted into instructions the printer can follow—a process called slicing. The slicer software determines:

- **Layer height** (finer layers = smoother surface but longer print time)
- **Infill percentage** (how solid the inside is)
- **Print speed** (balanced against quality)
- **Support placement** (where needed for overhangs)
- **Temperature settings** (optimized for the specific material)

We use BambuLab P1S and H2S printers with Bambu Studio for slicing. These machines are fast, reliable, and produce consistent results—but the settings still need human judgment to optimize for each specific part.

### During the Print

A typical print takes anywhere from 30 minutes to 20+ hours depending on size. During this time:

- The printer heats up and calibrates automatically
- Filament feeds through the heated nozzle
- The print head traces each layer's pattern
- Layer by layer, your part takes shape

Modern printers like ours include monitoring systems that can catch failures early. A print that detaches from the bed or tangles in filament usually gets stopped before wasting hours of time.

### Real-World Print Times

To give you a sense of scale:

- **Small items** (keychains, cable clips, small brackets): 30 minutes to 2 hours
- **Medium items** (phone stands, enclosures, figurines): 2 to 8 hours
- **Large items** (full-size props, big functional parts): 8 to 24+ hours

Our build volume maxes out at 250mm per side (about 10 inches cubed), with the H2S printer offering slightly more vertical room. Most customer projects fall well within these limits.

## Post-Processing and Quality Check

The print doesn't go straight from printer to shipping box. Several steps happen first.

### Support Removal

If your print needed supports—and most complex shapes do—those structures get carefully removed. We use a combination of tools to snap, cut, and sand away support material while minimizing marks on your part.

Support contact points will leave slight witness marks. Where possible, we orient prints so supports attach to less visible surfaces. But some geometry makes this unavoidable.

### Cleanup and Inspection

Every print gets inspected for:

- **Dimensional accuracy** (does it match the expected size?)
- **Surface defects** (any failed spots, blobs, or stringing?)
- **Structural integrity** (any cracks or delamination?)
- **Overall quality** (does it meet standards?)

Prints that don't pass get reprinted. You won't receive a part we wouldn't be happy with ourselves.

### Optional Finishing

Standard orders ship as-is from the printer (after cleanup). Some common requests that can enhance your print:

- Light sanding of visible surfaces
- Drilling or tapping holes
- Test-fitting multiple parts together

Let us know in your order notes if you need any special finishing work.

## Turnaround Time: What's Realistic?

Here's the honest truth about timing.

### Standard Orders: 2-5 Business Days

Most orders ship within 2-5 business days. This includes:
- Review and queue time (usually same day or next day)
- Print time (varies by size)
- Post-processing and quality check
- Packaging

Smaller, simpler parts often ship faster. Large or complex orders may take the full five days.

### What Can Extend Timing

**Large prints.** A 20-hour print simply takes 20 hours. There's no rushing the physics.

**Multiple revisions.** If we catch issues and need to discuss modifications, that adds communication time.

**Queue depth.** During busy periods, your order waits its turn. We don't cut corners to rush through a backlog.

**Material availability.** Most common colors stay in stock, but unusual requests might require ordering filament.

### Rush Orders

Need it faster? Let us know when ordering. We can often prioritize urgent projects, though print time itself can't be compressed. A 10-hour print still takes 10 hours even if it jumps to the front of the queue.

## What You'll Receive

When your order arrives, here's what to expect from the finished product.

### Surface Characteristics

FDM prints have visible layer lines. This is inherent to the technology, not a defect. Finer layer heights (0.12mm) minimize this effect; standard layers (0.2mm) are more visible but print faster.

The top surface shows a slightly different texture than vertical walls. The bottom—where the part contacted the print bed—comes out smooth and flat.

### Dimensional Accuracy

Expect accuracy within ±0.2-0.3mm for most features. This is typical for FDM printing. If you're designing parts that fit together, build in appropriate tolerances.

### Material Properties

Your part will have the properties of the material you chose:

- **PLA:** Stiff, good surface finish, softens above 60°C
- **PETG:** More flexible, impact-resistant, handles higher temps

The printed part behaves like solid plastic because it is solid plastic—just manufactured layer by layer instead of injection molded.

### Packaging

We package prints to survive shipping. Fragile or delicate items get extra padding. Multiple parts are separated to prevent rubbing or damage in transit.

## After You Receive Your Order

Got your print? Great. A few things to know about living with your new part.

### Break-In and Testing

If it's a functional part, test it right away. Check fit, function, and finish while details are fresh. If something's not right, let us know quickly—we want to make it right.

### Storage and Care

PLA and PETG are stable at room temperature. Keep them out of direct sunlight and away from heat sources (don't leave PLA parts in a hot car). Clean with mild soap and water if needed.

### Iterating on Designs

First print not perfect? That's common and expected in the design process. Many customers go through 2-3 revisions to dial in dimensions, tolerances, or features. Each iteration gets you closer to exactly what you need.
