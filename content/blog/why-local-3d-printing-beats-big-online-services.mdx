I started Mandarin3D because I needed something 3D printed and my options were terrible. The local library had a month-long wait. The big online services wanted hundreds of dollars. There had to be a better way.

Turns out, there is.

## The Problem with Big Services

Large 3D printing services look convenient at first. Upload a file, get a quote, done. But dig deeper and the problems start showing up.

**The pricing doesn't make sense.** A simple bracket that uses $2 of plastic somehow costs $45. Where's that money going? Overhead. Marketing. Layers of middlemen. Not into making your part better.

**Communication is a black hole.** Got a question about your order? Good luck getting a real answer. You'll talk to a chatbot, then a tier-1 support rep reading from a script, then maybe—if you're persistent—someone who actually knows about 3D printing.

**Turnaround is unpredictable.** "Ships in 3-5 business days" turns into two weeks. "Processing" status with no explanation. No way to know where your part actually is in the queue.

## What Local Gets You

Working with a smaller, local operation flips all of this.

**You talk to the person making your parts.** Questions get answered by someone who's actually going to run your print. That means real advice, not scripted responses.

**Pricing reflects actual costs.** No corporate overhead, no investor expectations, no marketing budget built into your quote. Just fair pricing based on what the print actually requires.

**Faster, more predictable delivery.** When I say about a week, I mean about a week. And if there's an issue, you hear about it right away—from me, not an automated email three days later.

**Flexibility the big guys can't offer.** Need to change something after you've ordered? Want advice on material selection? Have an unusual project that doesn't fit the standard options? That's all doable when you're working with a real person.

## Real Examples: Tech Companies Choose Local

Don't just take my word for it—some of the best tech companies have chosen to work with Mandarin3D for their custom printing needs.

### Vercel Ship Conference

When Vercel needed custom NFC keychains for their Vercel Ship developer conference, they came to Mandarin3D. Over 3,500 custom keychains—each one consistent, high-quality, and delivered on time.

This wasn't a small order, but it also wasn't the kind of massive volume that requires a factory. It was the sweet spot where local printing shines: large enough to matter, small enough to get personal attention on every piece.

### UploadThing Custom Plaque

Theo Browne, the creator of UploadThing and popular tech YouTuber, needed a custom plaque for a special occasion. The kind of one-off, unique piece that big services either can't do or charge absurd prices for.

With Mandarin3D, it was straightforward: send the design, discuss the details, get a beautiful finished piece. No ticket systems, no waiting for approval chains—just direct communication and quality results.

## The Local Advantage for Florida

If you're in Florida, local makes even more sense. Shipping from Jacksonville to anywhere in the state is fast and cheap. Order Monday, have it by Thursday—without paying for expedited shipping.

For businesses doing repeat orders, that proximity matters. Quick turnaround means faster iteration. Easier communication means fewer mistakes. And keeping money in the Florida economy? That's a nice bonus.

## When Big Services Make Sense

I'll be honest: the large services do have their place.

If you need exotic materials I don't stock (metal, full-color sandstone, etc.), they have more options. If you need a hundred thousand parts, they have the capacity.

But for the vast majority of projects—prototypes, custom parts, small to medium production runs—local wins on price, speed, and experience.
