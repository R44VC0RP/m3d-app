Choosing the right material for your 3D print can make or break your project. The two most popular options—PLA and PETG—each have their strengths. Here's how to pick the right one.

## PLA: The Everyday Choice

PLA (Polylactic Acid) is where most people start, and for good reason. It's easy to print, looks great, and works for the majority of projects.

**Best for:**
- Prototypes and concept models
- Display pieces and decorative items
- Parts that won't see heavy use
- Anything that stays indoors

**The good stuff:**
- Prints reliably with minimal fuss
- Great surface finish out of the box
- Wide range of colors available
- Eco-friendly (made from corn starch)
- No heated enclosure needed

**The trade-offs:**
- Softens around 60°C (140°F)—don't leave it in a hot car
- More brittle than PETG
- Not ideal for outdoor use long-term

### PLA in Action: Custom Keychains for Vercel

When Vercel needed over 3,500 custom NFC keychains for their Ship conference, PLA was the perfect choice. These keychains needed to look great and feel premium—but they weren't going to be thrown around or left in extreme conditions.

PLA delivered exactly what the project needed: consistent quality across thousands of pieces with a clean, professional finish.

## PETG: When Durability Matters

PETG (Polyethylene Terephthalate Glycol) is the step up when you need something tougher. It takes a bit more care to print but handles real-world abuse much better.

**Best for:**
- Functional parts and mechanical components
- Outdoor use
- Anything that needs to handle impact
- Parts exposed to moisture or chemicals

**The good stuff:**
- Much more impact-resistant than PLA
- Handles higher temperatures (up to ~80°C)
- Weather and UV resistant
- Good chemical resistance
- Slight flexibility prevents snapping

**The trade-offs:**
- Stringing can be an issue (though we've dialed that in)
- Slightly glossier finish
- Costs a bit more than PLA

### PETG in Action: Functional Mic Accessories

For parts that need to handle daily use and potential drops, PETG is the way to go. This custom microphone accessory needed to clip securely and survive being handled constantly.

The slight flexibility of PETG means it won't crack under stress, and it holds up to oils from hands and general wear.

## Quick Decision Guide

**Choose PLA if:**
- It's a prototype or display piece
- It'll live indoors
- You want the widest color selection
- Budget is a concern

**Choose PETG if:**
- The part needs to be functional
- It's going outside
- It might get dropped or stressed
- Heat resistance matters

## Still Not Sure?

Most projects work fine with PLA. When in doubt, start there. If you're building something that needs to survive daily use—a bracket, a mount, a tool holder—go with PETG.
