You've heard about 3D printing for years. Maybe you've seen the incredible things people create—custom parts, artistic sculptures, practical household fixes. Now you're ready to try it yourself. Here's everything you need to know to get your first 3D print right.

## What Actually Happens During a 3D Print

Before we dive into the practical stuff, let's quickly cover how FDM (Fused Deposition Modeling) printing works—it's the most common type, and it's what we use at Mandarin3D.

A 3D printer melts plastic filament and deposits it layer by layer, like a very precise hot glue gun controlled by a computer. Each layer is typically 0.1mm to 0.3mm thick. Stack enough layers together and you've got a solid object.

This layer-by-layer process means:
- **Horizontal surfaces look smooth** (the printer deposits full layers)
- **Vertical surfaces show layer lines** (you can see where each layer stacked)
- **Overhangs need support** (plastic can't print in mid-air)

Understanding this helps you set realistic expectations. A 3D print isn't injection molded—it has texture and character. That's part of what makes it interesting.

## Where to Get a 3D Model

You need a digital file before anything can be printed. There are two paths here:

### Download an Existing Design

Thousands of free models are available on sites like:
- **Thingiverse** — The largest collection, great for practical prints
- **Printables** — Prusa's platform, tends toward higher quality
- **MyMiniFactory** — Strong selection of artistic and gaming miniatures
- **Thangs** — Newer platform with good search functionality

Look for files in STL, OBJ, or 3MF format. These are the standard formats for 3D printing.

### Design Your Own

If you have something specific in mind, you'll need to create it. Don't worry—there are beginner-friendly options:

- **TinkerCAD** runs in your browser and requires zero experience. Perfect for simple shapes.
- **Fusion 360** is free for hobbyists and handles more complex designs.
- **Blender** is free and excellent for artistic, organic shapes.

We've written a full guide on [free CAD software for 3D printing](/blog/best-free-cad-software-for-3d-printing-in-2025) if you want to explore this route.

## Choosing the Right Material

For your first print, you'll likely choose between PLA and PETG. Here's the quick version:

### PLA (Polylactic Acid)

This is where most people start, and for good reason.

**Use PLA when:**
- You're printing something decorative or for display
- The part will stay indoors
- You want the widest range of colors
- Budget matters

**Watch out for:**
- PLA softens around 60°C (140°F). Don't leave it in a hot car.
- It's somewhat brittle—it can crack under sudden impact.

### PETG (Polyethylene Terephthalate Glycol)

Step up to PETG when durability matters.

**Use PETG when:**
- The part needs to survive daily use
- It's going outdoors
- It might get dropped or stressed
- Heat resistance is important

**Trade-offs:**
- Costs slightly more than PLA
- Fewer color options
- Slightly glossier finish

For a deeper comparison, check out our [PLA vs PETG guide](/blog/pla-vs-petg-which-material-should-you-choose).

**My recommendation for your first print?** Start with PLA. It's forgiving, affordable, and the results are great for most projects.

## Getting the Size Right

This trips up more beginners than almost anything else. 3D models don't always come at the size you need, and scaling matters.

**Before you order, verify:**

1. **Measure what you need** — If it's a replacement part, measure the original. If it's filling a specific space, measure that space.

2. **Check the model dimensions** — Most 3D printing services (including us) show you the model size before you order.

3. **Account for tolerances** — Printed parts are accurate to within about 0.2-0.3mm. If something needs to fit tightly inside something else, you may need slight adjustments.

Our build volume is 250mm in each dimension. That's roughly 10 inches cubed—plenty for most projects, from phone stands to replacement brackets to decorative pieces.

## What to Expect From the Finished Print

Let's set realistic expectations:

### You'll See Layer Lines

Layer lines are inherent to FDM printing. Finer layers (0.12mm) make them less visible; thicker layers (0.28mm) are more pronounced but print faster. For functional parts, this rarely matters. For display pieces, we default to finer layers.

### Overhangs and Supports

If your model has parts that jut out horizontally—like arms on a figurine or a shelf on a bracket—those sections need support material during printing. We add and remove supports as part of our process, but you may see slight marks where supports attached.

### Surface Finish Varies by Orientation

The top of a print looks different from the bottom. The bottom sits against the print bed and comes out smooth and flat. The top shows the final layer pattern. Vertical walls show layer lines. Consider which surface matters most for your project.

### Color and Texture

PLA and PETG come in various colors, from matte to silk to translucent. The color you choose affects how visible layer lines are—lighter colors show them more; darker colors hide them better.

## Common First-Print Mistakes to Avoid

Learn from others' mistakes:

### Downloading Random Files Without Checking Them

Not every free model is printable. Look for:
- Models marked as "print tested"
- User photos showing successful prints
- Comments discussing print settings

If a model has no makes (photos of successful prints) and no comments, proceed with caution.

### Ignoring Wall Thickness

Very thin walls (under 1mm) can fail to print or come out fragile. If you're designing your own model, keep walls at least 1.5mm thick for reliable results.

### Choosing the Wrong Orientation

How a model sits on the print bed affects strength, surface quality, and whether it even prints successfully. A part printed flat is stronger across its layers than one printed standing up. When you upload to a print service, the orientation matters—we'll advise if we think a different orientation would work better.

### Expecting Injection-Molded Perfection

3D prints have character. They're not mass-produced plastic goods, and that's actually a feature. The slight texture, the layer lines, the evidence that each piece was built one layer at a time—that's what makes 3D printing interesting.

## How the Ordering Process Works

Here's what happens when you order a print from Mandarin3D:

1. **Upload your file** — STL, OBJ, or 3MF format. You'll see a preview and dimensions immediately.

2. **Choose your options** — Material (PLA or PETG), color, and any notes about your project.

3. **We review it** — Before printing, we check that your model is printable. If there are issues—thin walls, impossible overhangs, manifold errors—we'll let you know and suggest fixes.

4. **Printing happens** — Using our BambuLab P1S and H2S printers, we print your part. Print time depends on size and complexity.

5. **Quality check and cleanup** — We remove supports, check for defects, and make sure it meets standards.

6. **Shipping or pickup** — Local Jacksonville customers can pick up; everyone else gets shipping.

The whole process typically takes 2-5 business days depending on queue and complexity.

## Your First Print: What Should It Be?

Not sure where to start? Here are some suggestions:

**Practical and useful:**
- A cable organizer for your desk
- A phone stand
- Wall hooks or hangers
- A replacement knob or handle

**Fun and decorative:**
- A small figurine or sculpture
- A custom nameplate
- A desk toy or fidget item

**Learning experience:**
- A calibration cube (yes, really—it teaches you what quality looks like)
- A benchmark print like the 3DBenchy

The best first print is something you'll actually use or enjoy. Don't overthink it.

## Ready to Print?

You've got the basics. You understand how it works, what materials to choose, and what to expect. Now it's time to actually do it.

[Upload your file](/upload) and let's make something. Whether it's a downloaded design you've been eyeing or something you sketched out yourself, I'll review it and make sure it prints well.

Got questions about a specific project? Just ask. That's the advantage of working with a local print service—actual humans who will tell you if your idea will work and help you fix it if it won't.
